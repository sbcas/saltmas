    It's the most saltiest time of the year
    (bring bong, bring bong!)
    With the 'adults' bitch-bitching
    And everyone telling you, "Get off Twitter!"
    It's the most saltiest time of the year
    (bring bong, bring bong!)

    It's the salt-saltiest season of all
    (bring bong, bring bong!)
    With those holiday sales and lame video meetings
    When the network drops out at home
    It's the salt-saltiest season of all
    (bring bong, bring bong!)

    There'll be whiskies for drinking
    Turkeys for roasting
    And peeing out in the cold

    There'll be real scary stories
    And tales of glories of
    Months long, long ago

    It's the most saltiest time of the year
    There'll be much boohooing
    And eyes will be bleeding when a shutdown is here
    It's the most saltiest time of the year

    There'll be whiskies for drinking
    Turkeys for roasting
    And peeing out in the cold

    There'll be real fake news
    And tales of the glories of
    Hours long, long ago

    It's the most saltiest time of the year
    There'll be much ermahgerding
    And thumbs will be glowing when 'executive time' is here
    It's the most saltiest time
    Yes, the most saltiest time
    Oh, the most saltiest time
    Of the year!
